# TkConvert

Just for fun.

A simple Chinese Convert program written by Tcl/Tk. It is used [tcl-opencc](https://github.com/ray2501/tcl-opencc) to do conversion between Traditional and Simplified Chinese.
OpenCC version requires >= 1.0.1.

I setup text widget font to `Noto Sans`, and maybe you need update this for you environment.
